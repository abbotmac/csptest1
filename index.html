  <title>My Favorite Things</title>
  <body>
  <h1>On this page you will find some of my favorite things.</h1>
  <p>This will include music/musicians,television shows,movies,dogs, and songs.
  <p>Lets get started with my favorite musicans.
  <ul>
  <li> First is Logic.<img src="Logic vibes.jpg"> He spreads a message of peace,love, and postivity. His songs have the ability to make me feel happy even when I don't want to.</li>
  <li>Next is Russ.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRsfbo8kTF4HAS3DCcbSCLx9tuORqC6NfG469ZBO6MiPSd_0hjRew">His voice has a rasp that makes you feel what he is singing about on another level.</li>
  <li> Blackbar is also a good artist.<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRh27EOCohPfnGvXtQBC5s1nxaSp4E7H2AU6shIW8brnb4icJBUzg"> He has a unique voice that sounds super auto tuned but it isn't. He is also very dedicated to his work and has a goofy personality</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Next up is television shows.
  <ol>
  <li>If you believe in or like supernatural entities then I think that you woud like <i>Supernatural</i>. <i>Supernatural</i> deals with "hunting" the supernatural and things like that. It is also a show that has good characters and good relationships.</li>
  <li>If you like a sort of mystery then <i>Stranger Things</i> is a good show. It throws back a litle bit in time and is based off of a supposed real life event.</li>
  <li> If you like a creepy show I would reccomend <i>American Horror Story</i>. Each season has a different theme but all seasons have the same returning actors. Personally I like <b>Hotel</b> or <b>Freak Show best</b>.</li>
  </ol> 
  <h3>Next up is movies.
  <ol>
  <lI> First up is <i>Kill Bill</i>. I like all of <i>Quentin Tarantino</i>'s films, but <i>Kill Bill</i> seems the best to me. It has a lot of action but it also is one of those iconic movies that if you heven't seen it then, what are you doing.</lI>
  <lI>Next is the <i>Divergent</i> series. This is set in the future after WWIII. It deals with discrimination and segregation but also is an action movie at the same time.</lI>
  <lI> <i>Hush</i> is a great horror movie. It is about a murderer who trys to break into a deaf woman's home to kill her.</lI>
  </ol>
  <h4>Now I will talk about my favorite dogs.
  <ul> 
  <li>Personally I love pit bulls and think that they are the most understood type of dog. People judge them based off of their breed, not how that particular dog acts and I think that is wrong.</li>
  <li>Another breed that I relly like are huskys. They have really pretty eyes and playful.</li>
  <li> Chihuahua's are really cute also. They are generally pretty small but they act and sound like they are big.</li>
  </ul>
