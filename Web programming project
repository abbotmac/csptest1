  <body>
  <h1>On this page you will find some of my favorite things.</h1>
  <p>This will include music/musicians,television shows,movies, and dogs.
  <p>Lets get started with my favorite musicans.
  <ul>
  <li> First is Logic he spreads a message of peace,love, and postivity. His songs have the ability to make me feel happy even when I don't want to.</li>
  <li>Next is Russ. His voice has a rasp that makes you feel what he is singing about on another level.</li>
  <li> Panic! at the Diso is a good band. They have a different feel/message to each album, and I personally enjoy that.Also, Brendon's vocal range is amazing.<li>
  </ul>
